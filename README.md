## ⚙️ **Prompting Patterns Compared:**

| **S.No** | **Prompting Type**                             | **Description**                                                      | **Key Strength**                                          | **Possible Limitation**                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | **Straightforward Prompting**                  | Direct question or task request without extra context.               | Simple and fast for clear, known tasks.                   | May yield incomplete or context-insensitive outputs.                 |
| 2        | **Tabular Format Prompting**                   | Structured prompt using tables for comparison or classification.     | Helps AI align outputs and maintain structured data.      | Needs consistent formatting and can confuse model if poorly aligned. |
| 3        | **Chain-of-Thought (Step-by-Step) Prompting**  | Guides AI to explain its reasoning process before the final answer.  | Enhances accuracy and transparency.                       | May increase response length.                                        |
| 4        | **Few-Shot Prompting**                         | Includes 1–3 examples before asking the main question.               | Improves performance on specific tasks.                   | Requires careful example selection.                                  |
| 5        | **Preceding Question Prompting**               | Builds context by asking a preliminary question before the main one. | Makes AI responses contextually richer.                   | Requires two-step interaction.                                       |
| 6        | **Missing Word / Fill-in-the-Blank Prompting** | AI must complete or infer missing information.                       | Encourages deeper contextual understanding.               | Risk of ambiguity if context unclear.                                |
| 7        | **Role-based Prompting**                       | Assigns a role to the AI (“You are a Python developer...”).          | Makes outputs more targeted and stylistically consistent. | May bias the tone or approach.                                       |

## 🧪 **Test Scenarios and Results**

Below are **realistic test cases** for comparing how these prompting types perform in a coding-related scenario:
**Scenario:** *“Generate Python code to interact with two APIs, compare outputs, and provide actionable insights.”*

---

### 🧩 **Scenario 1: Straightforward Prompting**

**Prompt:**

> Generate Python code to call two weather APIs, compare their outputs, and display the temperature difference.

**AI Output Summary:**

* Gave code that fetched data correctly but lacked normalization and insights.
* No comments or explanations for next steps.

**Evaluation:**
✅ Quick and short, ❌ limited analytical depth.

---

### 📊 **Scenario 2: Tabular Format Prompting**

**Prompt:**

> Generate a Python table comparing the outputs from OpenWeatherMap and WeatherAPI (fields: City, Temp, Humidity, Pressure, Wind). Then summarize the differences.

**AI Output Summary:**

* Produced neat tabular comparison (using `pandas`).
* Automatically computed column-wise differences.

**Evaluation:**
✅ Very structured output, ❌ required more manual interpretation for insights.

---

### 🧠 **Scenario 3: Chain-of-Thought Prompting**

**Prompt:**

> Step by step, explain how to:
>
> 1. Fetch data from two APIs
> 2. Normalize it
> 3. Compare it
> 4. Derive insights.
>    Then provide the Python code.

**AI Output Summary:**

* Explained reasoning before showing code.
* Provided logical steps, error handling, and insights.

**Evaluation:**
✅ Most accurate and educational, ❌ longer response time.

---

### 🔁 **Scenario 4: Few-Shot Prompting**

**Prompt:**

> Example 1: Compare outputs of two stock APIs and summarize key metrics.
> Example 2: Compare outputs of two weather APIs and provide insights.
> Now, generate Python code that performs a similar comparison for Air Quality APIs.

**AI Output Summary:**

* Used patterns from examples effectively.
* High consistency in structure and variable naming.

**Evaluation:**
✅ Reusable template pattern, ❌ performance depends on example quality.

---

### ❓ **Scenario 5: Preceding Question Prompting**

**Prompt:**

> What fields are typically compared between two weather APIs?
> Now write a Python program that fetches those fields and compares them.

**AI Output Summary:**

* Identified relevant fields first (Temp, Humidity, Pressure).
* Then generated targeted code.

**Evaluation:**
✅ Context-aware output, ❌ requires multiple interactions.

---

### ✍️ **Scenario 6: Missing Word Prompting**

**Prompt:**

> Write Python code that fetches weather data from API1 and API2, then ____ the temperature and humidity differences.

**AI Output Summary:**

* AI inferred the missing word “calculates.”
* Produced complete code with minimal supervision.

**Evaluation:**
✅ Tests AI inference ability, ❌ risk of wrong assumptions if context vague.

---

### 👨‍💻 **Scenario 7: Role-based Prompting**

**Prompt:**

> You are a Python developer and data analyst. Write optimized, well-commented Python code to compare weather API outputs and generate insights.

**AI Output Summary:**

* Produced professional, documented code.
* Included error handling, structured comments, and clear insights.

**Evaluation:**
✅ Best balance of readability and reliability, ❌ slightly verbose output.
